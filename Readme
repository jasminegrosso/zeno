			Zeno Source Distribution
			========================

Zeno is a collection of programs for N-body simulation and analysis.
Their primary purpose is numerical simulation of galaxies and galactic
encounters, but other applications both within and outside astrophysics
are also possible.

See the Instructions file for information on installing Zeno.

I would be grateful to receive feedback (both positive and negative) and
reports of bugs or problems as well as suggested improvements.  My free
time and other resources are relatively limited, so I may not be able to
correct problems or issue updates promptly, but I will acknowledge all

package was used in this research.").  I would also be glad to receive
